# Predictive Classification Model for UNMSM Admissions

## ðŸ§  Description
This project is a continuation of an initial analysis on a specific university entrance exam. 
In this second phase, the goal was to build a predictive and descriptive analysis using historical data from admission processes, 
applying data collection, processing, and visualization techniques.

In addition, a predictive classification model was developed to estimate whether a candidate will be admitted or not to the university, 
based on variables such as the academic program (major) and the admission period.

## ðŸ§  Project Structure

- **1. Web Scraping**  
  Automated extraction of historical admission data using Python and Selenium.

- **2. Data Wrangling**  
  Data cleaning, transformation, and integration focused on:
  - Admission modality
  - Academic program (major)
  - Campus location
  - Year and admission period

- **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Dataset preparation for analyzing trends, scores, campuses, and academic programs.

- **4. Power BI Visualization**  
  Interactive dashboards built to explore:
  - Score distributions
  - Trends in applicants and admitted students
  - Comparisons by academic program and campus
  - Newly launched academic programs

## ðŸ§  Key Findings

- New programs launched in 2025-II:
  - Forensic Criminology
  - Mechatronics Engineering
  - Nuclear Engineering
  - Maritime and Port Administration
  - Water Engineering and Treatment Technologies

- Lima is the campus with the highest number of applicants.
- **Human Medicine** remains the most in-demand program.
- **Drop in average scores** across many programs, partly due to the acceptance of candidates below the minimum score threshold of 900.
- **Programs with the highest number of available spots**:
  1. Law
  2. Accounting
  3. Business Administration
  4. Industrial Engineering
  5. Human Medicine

- Programs with the highest average scores in the latest exam (2025-II):
  1. Systems Engineering
  2. Biomedical Engineering

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python (Selenium, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Plotly)
- Power BI
